The NER RCC file is a modified dataset reader for the conll2003 data format. This file is the key piece to running any
NER code as we need to create a dataset object so that NER can label the datasets as datasets. The file is commented out
for the creation of the conll file. A new conll file should probably be created however, the conll file I have been using
is contained in the conll files directory. Instruction for running NER from top to bottom are contained the README of the
NER section.
